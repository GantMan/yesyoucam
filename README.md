### React on Take a Photo Completion
```ruby
  # called in BluePotion when the photo has been taken (or any activity is completed actually)
  # If you're not using a PMActivity you should capture the onActivityResult method.
  def activity_result(request_code, result_code, data)
    if (result_code == YesYouCam.OK) # OR Android::App::Activity::RESULT_OK
      # Photo success!
      p "Photo located at #{YesYouCam.photo_path}"
    else
      # Photo failed or was cancelled
    end
  end
```

### Want a PNG?
```ruby
  # Did you need a PNG instead of a JPG?
  YesYouCam.photo_path # Some JPG path
  YesYouCam.pic_to_png
  YesYouCam.photo_path # Some new PNG path
```
