![Don't Shia Way](_art/yyc.png)

## Usage

```ruby
  # First - Fire off a photo
  YesYouCam.capture_photo
```

### Need to know
```ruby
  # called when the photo has been taken
  def activity_result(request_code, result_code, data)
    if (result_code == YesYouCam.OK) # OR Android::App::Activity::RESULT_OK
      # Photo success!
      p "Photo located at #{YesYouCam.photo_path}"
    else
      # Photo failed or was cancelled
    end
  end
```

### JPG by default, but PNG is easy
```ruby
  # Did you need a PNG instead of a JPG?
  YesYouCam.photo_path # Some JPG path
  YesYouCam.pic_to_png
  YesYouCam.photo_path # Some new PNG path
```

### Need the photo discoverable by Photo Libraries?

### Let's let the user select a photo from their library!
